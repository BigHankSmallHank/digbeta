Trajectory Recommendation

Recommend trajectories for tourists using [YFCC100M dataset](http://www.referitgame.com/vicente/flickr100M/),
[OpenStreeMap dataset](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) and 
[dataset provided by authors of the ijcai15 paper](https://sites.google.com/site/limkwanhui/datacode#ijcai15).

Please visit [this notebook](./notes.ipynb) for detailed explanation and experimental results.

```images``` static images for iPython notebooks

```sim``` Trajectory simulation according to a Markov chain

The states of the Markov chain (MC) corresponds to the categories of POIs, there is a special state "REST" which represents that people are having rests after some travelling.
 
Simulate trajectories using the transition matrix of the MC, when choosing a specific POI within a certain category, use the following rules:

1. The Nearest Neighbor of the current POI 
1. The most Popular POI 
1. A random POI choosing with probability proportional to the reciprocal of its distance to current POI 
1. A random POI choosing with probability proportional to its popularity
 
Run the simulation a number of times, compute the transition probabilities (transition matrix) using the generated observations.
