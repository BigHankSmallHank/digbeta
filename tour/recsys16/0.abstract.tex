Recommending Points of Interest (POI) and trajectories to touriests by exploring data with 
geographical information from online social media is an interesting and challenging task.
We formulate trajectory recommendation as a structured prediction problem by incorporating 
both the preferences of POIs and sequential visiting patterns.
POI preferences were captured by applying learning to rank to a number of informative POI features
and POI sequential visiting patterns were modelled using a Markov Chain (MC) where transition 
probabilities were factorised according to several POI features.
Furthermore, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) were utilised to effectively combine POI rankings
and MC to predict a whole trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed apporoach yields significant performance improvements 
over the current state-of-the-art methods on a Flickr dataset with trajectories in five cities.
