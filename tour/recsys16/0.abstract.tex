Recommending Points of Interest (POIs) and trajectories to tourists by exploring data with 
geographical information from on-line social media is an interesting and challenging task.
We propose to utilize learning to rank and Markov Chain to capture the properties of POIs
as well as the transition pattern between POIs, transition probabilities between POIs were
factorized according to several POI features to deal with data sparsity.
Furthermore, a probabilistic model and a structured support vector machine were leveraged 
to combine the results of learning to rank as well as the Markov Chain to recommend trajectories.
Experimental results on four trajectory datasets extracted from Flickr photos show performance 
improvements of our approach over the state-of-the-art and reveal many interesting properties 
of trajectories in different datasets.
