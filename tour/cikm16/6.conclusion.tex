\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we present an approach to utilize learning to rank as well as factorized Markov Chain to explore both
POI properties and transition patterns between POIs, then combine them using a probabilistic model and structured 
support vector machine to recommend trajectory. 
We evaluate the performance of our approach on four trajectory datasets extracted from Flickr photos using both 
trajectory F$_1$-score and trajectory $\tau$, experimental results show not only performance improvements over 
state-of-the-art methods but also many interesting properties of trajectories in different datasets.
