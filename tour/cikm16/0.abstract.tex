Consider the problem of recommending a sequence of Points of Interest (POIs) as a tour
to travellers by exploring data with geographical information from online social media.
We propose ranking POIs from their features, and capturing the transition patterns between POIs
using a Markov Chain with factorised transition probabilities.
In addition, a probabilistic model and a structured Support Vector Machine were used
to combine the results of POI ranking as well as the POI-POI transitions.
Experimental results on five trajectory datasets extracted from Flickr photos show performance
improvements of our approach over the state-of-the-art and reveal many interesting properties
of trajectories in different datasets.
We demonstrate that using the F1 score on pairs of POIs in a tour provides a more
meaningful performance measure than F1 score on individual POIs, and show empirically that
combining ranks and routes recommends better trajectories.
