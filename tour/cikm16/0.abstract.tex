The problem of recommending tours to travellers an important and broadly studied area,
and suggested solutions include recommending Points of Interests (POIs)
or route planning approaches.
We consider the task of recommending a sequence of Points of Interest (POIs) as a tour
to travellers, that simultaneously uses information about POIs and routes.
Our approach unifies the treatment of various sources of information
by representing them as features in machine learning algorithms, enabling us to
learn from past behaviour without specialised treatment of
spatial, temporal and social information.
Information about POIs are used to learn a POI ranking model
that accounts for the start and end points of tours.
Data about previous trajectories are used for learning transition patterns between POIs that
enable us to recommend popular routes.
In addition, a probabilistic model and a structured Support Vector Machine were used
to combine the results of POI ranking as well as the POI-POI transitions.
To measure performance, such that we respect the order of visits, we propose
a new F1 score on pairs of POIs.
Empirical results on trajectory datasets show that our approach improves over prior
state-of-the-art, thus demonstrating that
combining ranks and routes enables better trajectory recommendations.
