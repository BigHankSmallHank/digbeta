### Setting

Study bandit problem where the arms are the nodes of a graph and the expected payoff of pulling an arm is a smooth function on this graph.

Assume that the graph is known, and its edges represent the similarities of the nodes. At time $t$, choose a node and observe its payoff. Based on the payoff, update model.

Assume that number of nodes $N$ is large, and interested in the regime $t < N$.
